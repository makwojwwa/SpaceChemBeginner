define({'Assignment':{d:'A specialised term used in the game for a game level. There are research, production, and defense assigments.',l:''},'Bonder':{d:'A special object inside the reactor. Used for adding or removing bonds between atoms.',l:''},'Cycle':{d:'A unit of measurement of execution of an assignment. A waldo requires at least one cycle to move to the next grid cell located along its path. The lower the number of cycles used in an assignment, the faster your solution is.',l:''},'Fusion Laser Target':{d:'A special object inside the reactor. Used for performing atomic fusion of two atoms to obtain a completely new one.',l:''},'Grid cell':{d:'The smallest section of the grid inside the reactor. Has the shape of a square.',l:''},'Instruction':{d:'A building block for algorithms in reactors. Must be placed inside the reactor along the path of a waldo so that it can be executed.',l:''},'Object':{d:'A component of a reactor, which is required for executing particular operations with the use of a corresponding instruction. It can be a bonder, a sensor or a fusion laser target.',l:''},'Reactor':{d:'The primary workspace in SpaceChem. This is where you use instructions to transform input atoms/molecules into output atoms/molecules. It is divided into input area, output area and the area between them.',l:''},'Sensor':{d:'A special object inside the reactor. Used for detecting which atom is present above it at a given moment.',l:''},'Structure':{d:'A component of production and defense assignments. It can be placed on the map and connected with another one via a pipeline. It can be an input structure, a reactor or an output structure.',l:''},'Symbol':{d:'A unit of measurement of execution of an assignment. Every instruction placed in the reactor counts as a symbol. The number of symbols used in an assignment does not reveal if your solution is fast or not.',l:''},'Waldo':{d:'In other words, a remote manipulator. Used inside the reactor for executing the instructions placed along a path. There are two of them: a red and a blue one.',l:''}});
