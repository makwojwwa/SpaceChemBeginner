It can be placed on the map and connected with another one via a pipeline. It can be an input structure, a reactor or an output structure.',l:''},'Waldo':{d:'In other words a remote manipulator. Used inside the reactor for executing the instructions placed along a path. There are two of them: a red and a blue one. Read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_manipulator',l:''}});
